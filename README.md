A submission for the 2018 Oklahoma and National TSA conferences by Choctaw Middle School TSA.

## Retrospective
Looking back, this site is very basic. I mean, the `<font>` element was used, and that was deprecated in HTML 4.01 (in 1999) and officially obsolete in HTML5 (in 2014)! We wrote it just as we were learning the most basic HTML and CSS. When our team was creating it, we were proud of how **amazing** the site was, not knowing just how little we had really done.

Everyone definitely experiences something similar in their lifetime; your old accomplishments aren't accomplishments at all. Your projects were primitive.

Of course, you have to start somewhere.

That's what this website was for us: a starting point. It seemed everyone else was just starting out, too. At the 2018 Oklahoma TSA State Conference, our submission won 2nd place. We went on to the National TSA Conference in Atlanta, GA, but had little luck there.

As we're getting into web development and are planning to compete this April in the high school arena, we're in that same mindset that we had making this project. Our site is going to be **amazing**; it's going to be one of the best ever created for a TSA competition.

While that's still up in the air, and will be until April (and maybe July), we're excited about our projects and the expertise we're gaining while working on them. We fully expect to look back on our current projects and realize how primitive even they are. We're not just expecting that, we're _hoping_ for it; if you don't look back at old projects and think about all of the things you did wrong, you haven't learned anything since.
