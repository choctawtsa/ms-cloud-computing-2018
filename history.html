        HOW DID CLOUD COMPUTING COME ABOUT?
      </font>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <font size="4">
        Cloud computing, as we know it today, took quite a while to get to where
        it is. Its inception was quite a while ago, when Myspace was called part
        of the "cloud" and Amazon was only known for selling books and movies.
        <br />
        <br />
        From 2000 through 2005, the dot-com bubble burst lead to the
        introduction of cloud computing. Failing internet companies dragged on
        the tech industry. Any internet companies that survived modernized their
        IT architectures, making them more robust and finding solutions that
        were more efficient.
        <br />
        Amazon entered the cloud market in 2006. They were one of the few
        internet companies that survived the dot-com bubble burst, but they
        decided that they would "pioneer the cloud computing movement." Amazon
        introduced their Amazon Web Services, or AWS for short. AWS is still
        being used today, powering many businesses beyond Amazon. Two years
        later, in 2008, Google, Cisco Systems, Myspace, and Microsoft join
        Amazon in offering cloud services.
        <br />
        <br />
        2009 through 2012 was a great time for the cloud. It picked up
        acceptance in small and enterprise businesses. AWS picked up the Obama
        for America team and had a partnership with NASA for the Curiosity Rover
        landing on Mars in 2012. Netflix joined Amazon Web Services in 2009.
        Apple joined the cloud computing business in 2011, introducing iCloud
        for its customers at its annual WWDC event.
        <br />
        <br />
        Today, most people seem to be using cloud computing, whether it's at
        work, school, or home.
