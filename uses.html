        WHAT CAN YOU DO WITH CLOUD COMPUTING?
      </font>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <font size="4">
        Cloud computing is extremely useful for both commercial and personal
        use. It provides a safe and secure place in which people may store their
        files, images and other important data and easily be able to access it
        via a phone, computer or other electronic device. Cloud computing is
        used by some of the biggest companies such as Netflix, Xerox, Pinterest,
        Instagram, Facebook, Apple, Google, and Microsoft. Many companies use
        cloud computing as a way of making business more efficient and easier to
        manage by allowing cloud sharing. The cloud is a great way to store data
        safely without having to purchase an external hard drive or other
        storage device, and it's affordable and easy to purchase more storage.
        <br />
        <br />
        Companies such as Apple and Google are both large supporters, and
        providers, of cloud computing.
        <br />
        Apple's iCloud comes with 5GB of storage with each account. You can
        easily upgrade your storage capacity, with 50GB coming in at
        $0.99/month, 200GB at $2.99/month, and 2TB at $9.99/month.
        <br />
        Google has their Drive. Google Drive comes with access to many of their
        services, such as Docs, Sheets, Slides, Forms, and more. Drive is easy
        to use and access, and a great way for small companies and schools to
        allow students and employees to have accounts and easily be able to
        store data and share that data with others. Google offers 15GB free, and
        you can upgrade to 100GB for $1.99/month or $19.99/year. 1TB is also an
        option, coming in at $9.99/month or $99.99/year.
        <br />
        <br />
        Schools can really make great use of cloud computing services. Google's
        offering seems to be the most appealing for schools. Drive makes it very
        easy to save work. If you don't finish in class, don't worry! You can
        just log in to your account at home and finish there. Google Classroom
        gives teachers all of the tools they need to assign and grade
        assignments. Teachers can post something like "Write a four-sentence
        summary over this selection," and a file will be attatched with the
        passage. Students can then click the create button and make a quick
        Google Doc with their summary. In the top right of the Google Doc
        toolbar, there will be a button that says "Turn in" that students can
        use to turn in their assignment once they're done. Students also receive
        a school email that they can use for school purposes. If students have
        questions about their homework, they can send a quick email to a teacher
        and get a response. For group projects, Google's suite of apps such as
        Docs, Sheets, Slides, etc. allows real-time collaboration between
        multiple people. That way, you can get more done at once.
