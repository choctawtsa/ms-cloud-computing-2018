        WHAT ARE THE CHALLENGES PEOPLE ARE FACING WITH CLOUD COMPUTING?
      </font>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <font size="4">
        There are quite a few challenges in regards to cloud computing. Namely,
        security and privacy. With the convenience of being able to access files
        from anywhere comes a price. Your files will be uploaded to the
        internet, which can &mdash; and has been &mdash; hacked. Your data is
        not 100% safe while uploaded to the cloud, despite many companies' best
        efforts. Your data may even be given away by some companies. Thinking
        otherwise is somewhat na&iuml;ve, and that na&iuml;vet&eacute; could
        have serious consequences.
        <br />
        <br />
        Reliability is also an issue. If, and when, these services get hacked,
        you might not only have your privacy taken away, but your files too.
        Having your files somewhere besides your computer can be an advantage,
        but it's also a major weakness for cloud computing. More and more
        businesses and schools are starting to rely upon the cloud. If the
        service that's being used goes down, you may not be able to complete
        what you need to. Files in the cloud can become inaccessible. At a
        workplace, you may not be able to fulfill a client's order and lose
        money. At school, you won't be able to finish an assignment and might
        get a bad grade, depending on how mean or nice your teacher is. Internet
        can also go down. That can be an issue as well, seeing as you need
        internet to access cloud computing services.
        <br />
        <br />
        Don't forget about availability, either. Schools and businesses can be
        set up in places where the average person may not have fast enough
        internet, or internet at all, to take advantage of the cloud. Sure, they
        may be able to use it at the school or business, but then it becomes a
        question of if it's worth it or not. If people are only using it at one
        place, what's the purpose of using the cloud instead of just saving it
        to the computer's hard drive or a flash drive? An organization must
        consider whether it's more cost effective to purchase a cloud computing
        plan or just to give everyone a flash drive.
