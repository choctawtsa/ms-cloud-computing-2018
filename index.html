        WHAT DOES IT DO?
      </font>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <font size="4">
        You can kind of think of cloud computing as using a computer from
        another place to store your files or process data, so you don't have to.
        Average people usually only care about the storage component of cloud
        computing. There's plenty of reason to, right? People usually have
        powerful enough hardware on the machine they're running, but some people
        run out of storage pretty often. People who take lots of pictures,
        download lots of music, etc. sometimes run out of storage on their
        device, but luckily, there are multiple cloud computing services out
        there that will store those files for you. Some services give you some
        storage for free and require you to pay to get more, and there are some
        other services that you have to pay to get any storage.

        WHAT ARE SOME CLOUD COMPUTING SERVICES?
      </font>
    </h3>
    <p>
      <font size="4">
        There are quite a few, actually. These services are mainly divided into
        two categories: personal or enterprise.
        <br />
        <br />
        On the personal side, you have services like Apple's iCloud, Google's
        Drive, or Microsoft's OneDrive. All support storage of files like
        documents, presentations, pictures, spreadsheets, and much more. Google
        Drive's cloud computing services also come with things like Google Docs,
        Slides, Sheets, Keep, Gmail, Translate, Photos, News, Maps, Search,
        Calendar, and more that can be accessed from virtually anywhere. iCloud
        comes with Keynote, Numbers, iMovie, GarageBand, Pages, Photo Library,
        Mail, Calendar, Maps, News, Notes, Reminders, iMessage, Health,
        Wallet/Apple Pay, Contacts, iTunes, and more. iCloud's services are
        easier to work with and access on Apple devices (iOS, macOS, etc.), but
        most services can be accessed via the web or apps. OneDrive works well
        with Microsoft's Office 365 program and helps store files made in Office
        applications such as Word, PowerPoint, Excel, Publisher, etc., but
        Office 365 is a seperate purchase and is not included with OneDrive.
        <br />
        We'd like to note that though iCloud is it's own service, it does use
        other services to store its users' data. The services iCloud uses used
        to be Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure, but now it seems like
        they use Google servers and Amazon Web Services.
        <br />
        <br />
        Then there's the enterprise/business side of things. You'll find
        services like Google G Suite, Microsoft Azure, Amazon Web Services, IBM
        Cloud, and more here. These services do some remote computing for their
        clients as well as storing files the same as personal cloud services.
        Some of these services offer cool things, such as G Suite offering your
        own email domain with any purchase.
